Known bugs for top-memory.sh

* [race condition]

	The script runs *command*; in parallel, top il launched. When
	*command* ends, top is killed.

    So, if *command* is too quick to terminate (before top has been
    launched), the top process will not get killed.

	To circumevent this bug, the implementation adds a delay of 3
	seconds before attempting to kill top if *command* fails (exit
	code > 0).  If your system is too slow, 3 seconds may not be
	sufficient.
